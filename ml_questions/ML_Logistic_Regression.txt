Logistic Regression:
Logistic regression is similar to linear regression, except
Logistic regression predicts whether something is True or False, instead of predicting something continuous like size.
also, instead of fitting a line to the data, logistic regression fits an "S" shaped "logistic function".
The curve goes from 0 to 1, that means that the
curve tells us the probability that a mouse is obese based on its weight.

Although logistic regression tells the probability that a mouse is obese or not, it's usually used for classification.
For example, if the probability a mouse is obese is > 50%,
then we'll classify it as obese, otherwise we'll classify it as
"not obese".

In other words, just like linear regression, logistic regression can work with continuous data (like weight and age) and discrete data (like genotype and astrological sign).

Instead, we just test to see if a variable's effect on the prediction is significantly different from 0.
If not, it means the variable is not helping the prediction.

logistic regression uses something called "maximum likelihood".
1. You pick a probability, scaled by weight, of observing an obese
mouse - just like the curve...
2. and we use that to calculate the likelihood of observing a non-
obese mouse that weighs this much.
3. and then you calculate the likelihood of observing different mouse (step 2)
4. and lastly you multiply all of those likelihoods together. That's the likelihood of the data given this line.
5. Then you shift the line and calculate a new likelihood of the data.
...then shift the line and calculate the likelihood again... and again..
6. Finally, the curve with the maximum likelihood is selected.
